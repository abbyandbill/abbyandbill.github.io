title: What to eat in Chicago
---

Below are restaurants we have tried and liked!

Pequods (deep dish pizzaz is a Chicago signature; we prefer this local joint over more commercialized spots like Lou Malnati's or Giordano's which are also fine choices) 

Portillo's (known for Chicago hot dogs and Italian beef)

The Purple Pig (Mediterranean) one of our go-to's for when friends visit. Supposedly the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. 

Bazaar Meat (Google says Steakhouse, but really a lot more) by a celebrity chef Jose Andres. Has a nice view of the Chicago River.

Bar Mar (Seafood) same chef, right downstairs from Bazaar Meat

Gibson Italia (Steak + Italian) Bill's manager had supposedly gone there for his birthday over the last ten years; great view of the Chicago river

Kasama (Filipino) lunch is popular/quick and dinner is a tasting menu

3 Arts Club Cafe (American) really nice quiet ambiance, and is on the bottom floor of a five-storied furniture store so we usually take a walk afterwards

Prime and Provision (steak/American) 

places in Chinatown (QXY, MCCB, Wentworth, Wing Yip Seafood)
