title: What to eat in Chicago
---

Below are restaurants we have tried and liked!

1. **Pequods** (deep dish pizza is a Chicago signature; we prefer this local joint over more commercialized spots like Lou Malnati's or Giordano's which are also fine choices) 

2. **Portillo's** (known for Chicago hot dogs and Italian beef)

3. **The Purple Pig** (Mediterranean) one of our go-to's for when friends visit. Supposedly, it's the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. 

4. **Bazaar Meat** (Google says Steakhouse, but it's really a lot more) by celebrity chef Jose Andres, and has a nice view of the Chicago River.

5. **Bar Mar** (Seafood) same chef, right downstairs from Bazaar Meat

6. **Gibson Italia** (Steak + Italian) Bill's manager had gone there for his birthday over the last ten years; good view of the Chicago river

7. **Kasama** (Filipino) lunch is popular (might be a line) and dinner is a tasting menu

8. **Three Arts Club Cafe** (American) really nice ambiance, and is on the bottom floor of a five-storied furniture store so we usually take a walk afterwards

9. **Prime and Provision** (steak/American) 

10. places in Chinatown (**QXY** - dumplings, **MCCB** - Chinese/Taiwanese, **Wentworth** - Canto-style, **JM Seafood** - Canto-style)
