Hello friends and family, 

We are delighted to announce that we are hosting our wedding ceremony and reception on August 31st, 2024 in Chicago, with a welcome party on the afternoon of August 30th. We'd be honored by your presence.

We have secured block rates at a few [hotels](/hotel_block.md) if you're interested.

We'll update the website in the next few months with a list of touristy things that we've enjoyed in our 2.5 years in this lovely city, as well as more details about the wedding.
