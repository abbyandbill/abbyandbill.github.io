Hello friends and family, we are delighted to announce that we are hosting our wedding ceremony and reception on August 31st, 2024 in Chicago, with a welcome party on the afternoon of August 30th. We'd be honored by your presence. More details to come in the coming months. 

We secured block rates at a few hotels if you're interested, [hotel blocks](/hotel_block.md).

We'll update the website in the next few months with a list of touristy things that we've enjoyed in our 2.5 years in this lovely city.
