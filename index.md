Hello friends and family, 

We are delighted to announce that we are hosting our wedding ceremony and reception on August 31st, 2024 in Chicago, with a welcome party on the afternoon of August 30th. We'd be honored by your presence.

We have secured block rates at a few [hotels](/hotel_block.md) if you're interested.

We mailed our physical wedding invites on May 14th, which contains a QR code to RSVP. Here is the link to the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qKb-qkMPHtPiIATk7a7MEcVVhMSMDfSrbLthg31Gu0Q/) just in case.

For out-of-town guests who could use some ideas on what to do for the remainder of the long weekend, we wrote down some of our favorite [things to do](/fun.md) in Chicago.
